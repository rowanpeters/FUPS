<h1>Frequently Used Phrases (FUPs)</h1>

<p><b>FUPs</b> are <b>frequently used phrases</b> e.g., instructional copy that I frequently use as scaffolding in storyboards and scripts that form the foundation for the digital learning experiences I build.</p>
<p><b>It's the type of writing that guides and manages expectations and experience.</b></p>

<p>Often similar, but never the same, FUPs provide me with a quick short-hand and increase my writing efficiency and effectiveness during peak production periods. I store them on the FUPs repo so they're available to me whereever and whenever.</p> <p>Thanks.</p>
